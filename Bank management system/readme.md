# Bank management system

This is my first C project. I choose this one because of its simplest project idea and i liked this.

This project must be organized according to this structure:

    * Login Module
    * Create new account
    * Update Exist account
    * Transactions Module
    * Check Existing account details
    * Delete Account
    * View Customer List
